# PedalTuner

A SwiftUI based tuner interface inspired by a pedal-style canvas tuner. The interface mimics the pedal's circular display and provides live pitch detection using `AVAudioEngine`.

## Features
- Circular gradient ring similar to the Canvas tuner.
- Needle style indicator showing pitch deviation in cents.
- Displays detected note name.

## Building
This project is packaged as a Swift Package and can be opened in Xcode as an iOS application. Run the app on a device to access the microphone and see the tuner in action.
